# RavenmineData
Very simple node script to read a bit of extra data from the ravenmine pool.  


Requires node to be installed to work.
Data is accurate for around 12 hours then we run out of data.  console must continue to run to collect more data.  Longer timeframes will populate accurately if the app keep running.

run 
npm install

to get the dependencies.

run with:  node main --u walletxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  

Output updates every 60 seconds
